  <h1>Sleigh Bells - Hyper Dark
  </h1>
  <p>Quick, assemble a symbol, a solution
    You're stalling
    Flags tangle in the wind
    Slash, slash
    Slash, slash
  </p>
  <p>
    Hyper dark
    I think we have a problem
    Hyper dark
    So, you like trouble
    I think we have a problem
    Hyper dark
    </p>
   <p>Hey now, big date, tongue in her shade
      Then you're going all the way
      All those kids
      Wasting away
      On a yearbook page
      That was torn out anyway
    </p>
